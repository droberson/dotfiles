Daniel Roberson's dotfiles
==========================

Greetings, cyberpals!

Here's a collection of my dotfiles. I use this mainly to keep changes
to my dotfiles synchronized across my workstations, laptops, and shell
accounts. Having to switch between inconsistent environments non-stop
can really be a bummer. Hopefully you can find something insteresting
or helpful from these!

I have currently only tested these on Slackware, Ubuntu, FreeBSD, and
OpenBSD. There are some minor inconsistencies between distros and
operating systems, but they will be dealt with as time marches on.


Installation
------------

To install, type the following into your shell:
