Daniel Roberson's dotfiles
==========================

Here's a collection of my dotfiles. I use this mainly to keep changes
to my dotfiles synchronized across my workstations, laptops, and shell
accounts. Hopefully you can find something insteresting or helpful
from these!

I have currently only tested these on Slackware, Ubuntu, FreeBSD, and
OpenBSD. There are some minor inconsistencies, but they will be dealt
with in the near future!


Installation
------------

To install, type the following into your shell:

- cd
- git clone https://github.com/droberson/dotfiles.git
